== Work Allocation
The purpose of this application is to replace conventional methods of tracking assigned work.
My vision includes using a web-based system to keep track of all assigned and outstanding work. 

I appreciate that there are a number of open source systems and commercially available products, yet the main objective for me is to 
learn Ruby on Rails and to build a locally significant application.

* User management is somewhat limited
